House Rent Prediction with Machine Learning
This project demonstrates how to predict house rent prices using a machine learning model in Python. The prediction is based on a dataset containing various features such as BHK, size, city, and furnishing status.

Project Overview
The main objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the rent of a house based on its characteristics. The process involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering (handling categorical variables), and training a regression model.
