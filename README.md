# House Rent Prediction with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to predict house rent prices using a **machine learning regression model** in Python.  
The predictions are based on key features such as **BHK, size, city, and furnishing status**.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can **accurately predict house rents** based on property characteristics.  
The workflow includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering (handling categorical variables)  
- Model training and evaluation using regression techniques
